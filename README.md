# Data-Analysis-Tools

Tools I built during 2021 Montana State University REU program. I was workin in the Grumstup lab. These tools are for processing data gathered with the pump-probe microscopy.

Can be used to generate kinetics plots and animations of exciton diffusion. Tried to implement diffusion coefficent calculations following this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c02302).
Didn't get it working before the end of the summer unfortunaly.
